                <p>TWICE has achieved a historic first on the Billboard charts!

                    For the week ending on June 26, TWICE’s new mini album “Taste of Love” debuted at No. 1 on three separate Billboard charts. “Taste of Love” entered Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart, Top Current Album Sales chart, and World Albums chart at No. 1.
                    
                    With this latest achievement, TWICE has become the first girl group in history—not just K-pop—ever to top Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart with an EP. Only five other girl groups have ever topped the chart with any album at all: Destiny’s Child, TLC, Spice Girls, Danity Kane, and BLACKPINK.
